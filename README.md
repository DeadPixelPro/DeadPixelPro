Hey, I'm DeadPixelPro. I'm currently a student at RIT. That's.... really about it. I'm hoping that I'll be able to contribute to various projects soon, notably in the console modding and emulation scenes, but... we'll see how that goes. If you have a question about something, it'd be best to reach me at @DeadPixelPro on almost any platform, but notably Discord and Twitter.
